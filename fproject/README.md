This is my Final Project for CS50x

My name is Lucas, i'm 26 man, from Recife/Brazil. I've loved computers since a little boy and learned the basics of coding
when i was 10 years old, writing some ruby lines. 

My final project is a human resources panel, that shows information about employess from over 40 branches. Basically shows
information about their jobs (positions), branches, name and risk of leaving the company. The idea of the project was from 
my old job, that i'd to consolidate over 40 diferent worksheets everymonth to gather this information. 

I manage to use ajax and jquery on the plataform, soo it would not have to refresh the page to show new information. Also, 
i put access restrition to different users, so they can only see the branches they work with. 

My plans are to improve the plataform, learn more of front-end to change the layout and put more information on the panel.
